# 🎃 Hacktoberfest Jam 2025

Welcome to the **Hacktoberfest Jam 2025** — a month-long, beginner-friendly coding event where students learn Git, collaborate on creative projects, and build something fun for our **Tech or Treat** challenge.  

This isn’t a high-pressure hackathon — it’s a jam session!  
You’ll learn, experiment, and create at your own pace while connecting with other developers.

## 🧭 How It Works

1. **Fork** this repo.  
2. Complete the starter **Tasks** in [`/tasks`](./tasks) to learn Git and GitHub basics.  
3. Open **Pull Requests (PRs)** to submit your progress.  
4. Move on to the **🎭 Tech or Treat Challenge** to design something clever, spooky, or surprising!  
5. Present your project at the showcase — our panel of judges will award creativity, execution, and presentation.
