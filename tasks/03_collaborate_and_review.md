1) Go to the **Pull Requests** tab:  
   👉 [View Open PRs](https://github.com/TristianSellers/Hacktober-Fest-Jam-2025/pulls)

2) Pick an open PR from another student and review:  
   - The title and description  
   - Files changed  
   - Commit messages  

3) Leave a **friendly, constructive comment** on their PR:  
   - “This looks great! I like how you organized your folder.”  
   - “You might want to add a short README for clarity.”  
   - “Nice idea! Maybe use backticks to format code.”  

4) React to one or more comments with 👍 or 🎉  

5) After commenting, reply in this issue with:  ✅ Reviewed PR #<number> by @<username>
    ```bash
    Example:  
    `✅ Reviewed PR #12 by @tristiansellers`
