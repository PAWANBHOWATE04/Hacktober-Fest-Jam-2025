# Tech or Treat (Trick or Tech) 🎃

**Theme:** Design a small project that deceives, surprises, or plays a clever trick on the user — in a *fun, creative, or thought-provoking* way.
Examples: a webpage that changes behavior when you’re not looking 👀, an app that misleads (then reveals the joke), or a game with unexpected twists.

This is an **optional challenge** that complements Hacktoberfest. It should **not** replace your open-source contributions — think of it as a capstone you can add to our repo.

## How to participate
1. Create a branch: `feat/<github-username>-trick` (teams: `team/<team-name>-trick`)
2. Make a new folder: `challenges/tech-or-treat/<your-project-slug>/`
3. Include:
   - `README.md` — pitch, how to run, what’s the “trick”
   - `LICENSE` — MIT or similar
   - `demo.gif` or `demo.mp4` — short screencap
   - Source (e.g., `/web/`, `/src/`, or a link if hosted elsewhere)
4. Open a PR with the title: `Tech or Treat: <project name>`

## Judging (bonus points)
- Surprise/Cleverness (10)
- Craft/Polish (10)
- Technical Execution (10)
- Accessibility/Ethics/Consent (5)
- Presentation (5)

> **Up to +30 bonus** may count toward your final score in `SCORECARD.md` as Creativity & Initiative (and Presentation).

## Safety & consent
- Keep it respectful (no harassment, hate, or harmful deception).
- Explicitly reveal the “trick” in your README.
- Follow our [Code of Conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Quick ideas
- **Shy UI:** elements move or change only when the tab/window loses focus.
- **Time-based twist:** content shifts after a delay or at specific times.
- **Audio/ambient cues:** subtle shifts that build to a reveal.
- **Impossible forms:** playful inputs that teach validation.
